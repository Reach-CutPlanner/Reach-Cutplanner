            Carrying out Apparel Pattern Engineering, Grading and Marker Planning manually is a notoriously inefficient and cumbersome process. REACH CAD effects significant time and labor savings by automating this process.
          </p>

          <p>
            REACH CAD streamlines and improves efficiency of the fashion product development team by safeguarding against people turnover, eliminating manual errors, building knowledge base that can be used to create and re-create garment patterns and garment markers and by enabling collaborative team working. Manual patterns of garments get worn-out and torn and cannot be re-used to create even slightly different fashion styles.
          </p>

          <p>
            REACH CAD uses apparel specific intuitive and user-friendly tools to engineer garment patterns, grade the base garment pattern to various other sizes and to tightly pack these garment patterns to form the most efficient garment markers. Figuring out optimal layout of clothing patterns to form tight clothing markers needs the application of spatial visualization skills: this is best done on a computer monitor and not by going back and forth on a table.
