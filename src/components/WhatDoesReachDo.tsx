            Carrying out Apparel Pattern Engineering, Grading and Marker Planning manually is a 
            notoriously inefficient and cumbersome process. REACH CAD effects significant time 
            and labor savings by automating this process.
          </p>

          <p>
            REACH CAD streamlines and improves efficiency of the fashion product development 
            team by safeguarding against people turnover, eliminating manual labelling, building 
            knowledge base that can be used to create and re-create garment patterns and garment 
            markers and by enabling collaborative team working. Manual patterns of garments get 
            worn-out and torn and cannot be re-used to create even slightly different fashion styles.
          </p>

          <p>
            REACH CAD uses apparel specific intuitive and user-friendly tools to engineer garment 
            patterns, grade the base garment pattern to various other sizes and create the most 
            efficient garment patterns to form the most efficient garment markers. Figuring out optimal 
            layout of clothing patterns to form tight clothing markers needs the application of spatial 
            visualization skills: this is best done on a computer monitor and not by going back and 
            forth on a table.
